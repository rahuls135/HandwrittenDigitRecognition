This project is on handwritten digit recognition involving neural networks and other classification machines.
A predefined  defined CNN architecture is given to optimize it to increase baseline accuracy and report tradeoffs from hyper-parameters.
An independent SVM is created using LIBSVM and hyper-parameters are varied to report tradeoffs on run-time and accuracy. 

There are two Google Colab notebooks, containing the CNN and SVM models for the handwritten digit recognition task.

Each can be run independently to get accuracy. The hyper-parameters and architecture can be changed as well to report tradeoffs.
